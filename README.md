MERN & LAMP developer | Frontend focused

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Full Stack Web Developer with a focus on building dynamic and responsive web applications using modern technologies.

### Experience

#### Shifti (2021 - Present)

My journey at Shifti commenced as a CMS developer, initially leaving me somewhat disheartened. However, this position turned out to be a valuable learning experience. Over time, I delved into fundamental technologies such as Native CSS, Semantic HTML, and honed my skills in web performance optimization, SEO, and web accessibility.

After half a year, I was thrilled to be promoted to a full-stack web developer role. This marked a significant turning point in my career, as I delved into collaborative projects involving intricate web applications. This experience taught me the importance of maintaining clean, well-structured code and implementing thorough testing practices to ensure robust solutions.
